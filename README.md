# Pathfinding Visualizer

This project, named "Pathfinding Visualizer," is a web application built using React. It provides a graphical representation of various pathfinding algorithms and maze generation patterns. Users can interact with the grid, visualize algorithms such as Dijkstra's and A*, and observe the process of finding the shortest path between a start and a target node.

## Features
- **Node Representation:** Nodes on the grid represent various states, such as start node, target node, visited nodes, shortest path nodes, and walls.
- **Algorithm Visualization:** Visualize pathfinding algorithms like Dijkstra's and A* in real-time.
- **Maze Generation:** Generate different maze patterns, including stair patterns, recursive division mazes, and basic random mazes.
- **User Interaction:** Users can interact with the grid by dragging the start and target nodes, toggling walls, and customizing the animation speed.

## Usage
1. **Choose Algorithm:** Select the pathfinding algorithm from the dropdown menu. Options include Dijkstra's Algorithm and A* Search.
2. **Generate Mazes:** Use the "Mazes & Patterns" dropdown to generate various maze patterns, such as a simple stair pattern, recursive division maze, or basic random maze.
3. **Visualize:** Click the "Visualize!" button to initiate the visualization of the selected algorithm or maze generation pattern.
4. **Customize Speed:** Adjust the animation speed using the "Speed" dropdown.
5. **Clear Actions:** Clear the board, walls, or path using the respective "Clear" buttons.

## Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`
Installs the necessary dependencies for the project.

### `npm start`
Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

## Note
This project is designed for educational purposes to demonstrate pathfinding algorithms and maze generation. Feel free to explore and experiment with different configurations.

**Happy Pathfinding!**
